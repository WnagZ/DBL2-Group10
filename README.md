## Gathering Data
For this project, we made use of data from the Metropolitan Police. These are available on: https://data.police.uk/data/archive/

With the downloaded datafiles, run the notebooks in the DataCreation folder to get the correct data.

## Tableau Dashboard
The dashboard can be accessed with the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rob.borsboom/viz/trustandconfidence/Dashboard

To run the dashboard locally, use the file provided in the Tableau folder to run the data. You will need to replace the datasources with your locally downloaded files.
